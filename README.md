## âš€ Purpose of Development:
> This project was initially developed as a proof of concept for developing reactive User Interfaces for the terminal in C from scratch, with the goal of demonstrating a responsive nested component layout similar to other high-level GUI toolkits / frameworks instead of a traditional vertical, top to bottom layout commonly used by terminal emulators / shells. Also acted as a small-sized starter project during the time I was learning the fundamentals of C

## âš€ FAQ:
- **Why are the navigation hotkeys bound to [WASD] instead of vim hotkeys [HJKL]?
- > windows users man...
- **"Does this work with Windows Powershell / CMD?"**:
- > yeah
- **"Shouldn't this project be a notepad instead?"**:
- > yeah
- **"Was the AES128 integration necessary?"**:
- > yeah
- **"Why did you code this in C?"**:
- > yeah
